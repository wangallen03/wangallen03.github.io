Isolation isn’t a natural state for many people. We are, for the most part, social beings. We enjoy each other’s companionship. That’s what can make staying at home for extended periods of time difficult. Today, we are going to talk about being trapped indoors for a long period of time.

隔离对许多人来说不自然。我们在很大程度上是社交群体。我们喜欢彼此的陪伴。这就让长时间呆在家里变得困难。今天，我们要谈论长时间被困在室内的问题。

Cabin fever is a condition. It happens when someone is stuck inside for a long period of time. If someone is unable to get outside into fresh air or be around other human beings, they may start to feel trapped, unhappy, restless and bored.

幽居病是一种状态。当某人长时间被困在里面时，就会发生这种情况。如果某人无法出去获得新鲜空气或周围的人，他们可能会开始感到被困、不快乐、不安和无聊。

Cabin fever isn’t a recognized psychological disorder, but that doesn’t mean the feelings aren’t real. The distress is very real. It can make fulfilling the requirements of everyday life difficult.

幽居病不被认为是心理障碍，但这并不意味着（负面）感觉不是真的。窘迫（的感觉）是非常真实的。它可以使日常生活的基本需要变得困难。

Word historians say “cabin fever” probably came into use in the late 1800s in North America. Early settlers lived in log cabins. They would spend long winters by themselves. Cold, windy weather and great distances from other people created a truly isolating existence for months at a time.

一些历史学家说，"幽居病"可能于19世纪后期在北美开始使用。早期移民住在小木屋里。他们会自己度过漫长的冬天。寒冷、多风的天气和远离其他人的遥远，营造了真正的孤立无援，一次几个月。
