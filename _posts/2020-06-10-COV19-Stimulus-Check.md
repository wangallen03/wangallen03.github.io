Direct deposit: 
On April 11, the IRS announced it had deposited the first stimulus payments into taxpayers’ bank accounts. People had until May 13 to provide the IRS with their direct deposit information if they didn’t want a paper check.
直接存取：4月11日，美国国税局宣布，他们已将首笔刺激款项存入纳税人的银行账户，须在5月13日之前向国税局提供直接存款信息，如果他们不想用纸质支票。
Paper checks: 
Paper checks started going out the week of April 20, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. The IRS says the number of paper checks disbursed will increase sharply in May.

预付卡：5月18日，美国财政部宣布，将开始通过MetaBank银行预付卡（而不是纸质支票）发送近400万个疫情援助支票。该卡可在线、ATM 取款机或接受 Visa 的任何地方使用。
If you receive Supplemental Security Income from the Social Security Administration: SSI recipients will receive their IRS payment in early May.
如果您在社会保障管理局有救济社保收入（SSI ），收款人将在 5 月初收到其 IRS 付款。
Elderly and disabled people 老人与残疾人
Most senior citizens will qualify for a check. The exception: Those claimed as dependents by their children or someone else.
大多数老年人都有资格。例外情况：那些被子女或其他人称为赡养人。
Disabled adults are eligible for a stimulus check as long as no one else claims them as a dependent. If so, they don’t qualify. For example, if a disabled adult lives at home with his or her parents and the parents claim him or her as a dependent on their income taxes, the disabled adult won’t receive a check.
残疾成年人有资格接，只要没有人声称他们作为赡养人。如果是则不符合资格。例如，如果残疾成年人与父母一起住在家中，而父母则声称他或她是受其所得税的赡养者，则残疾成人将得不到支票。
