### Medicare Part C & D  （C & D医保计划）

#### Medicare Part C （C医保计划）

A Medicare Part C (also called Medicare Advantage) plan is a private insurance policy that replaces Medicare Part A and Part B. If you enroll in a private Medicare Part C plan, you no longer receive coverage through Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B.

C医保（也称为高级医疗保险优势）计划是取代医疗保险A&B的私人医保。如果您注册了私人医疗保险 C计划，则不能再通过A计划 B计划获得医疗保险。

Medicare Part C plans are regulated by the federal government, which requires every plan to provide at least the same coverage as the government-run Medicare Parts A and B. Medicare Part C plans eliminate some Medicare co-payments and deductibles and may provide additional benefits, making them attractive to some seniors.

医疗保险C部分计划由联邦政府监管，它要求每个计划提供至少相同的保险，作为政府经营的医疗保险的 A和 B计划。


If a potential enrollee doesn’t enroll in Part C or D when they turn 65, or if they want to switch coverage under Part C or D, they can do so during Medicare’s annual enrollment period, which falls between October 15 and December 7. (Some managed care plans and insurance companies also allow enrollment throughout the year.)
如果老人在 65 岁时未注册 C 或 D 医保计划，或者如果希望根据 C 计划或 D 计划切换覆盖范围，他们可以在 10 月 15 日至 12 月 7 日的医疗保险年度注册期间注册。（一些托管护理计划和保险公司也允许全年注册）。


#### Medicare Part D （D医保计划）

Part D is a collection of private plans that cover prescription medications. The federal government sets the basic rules for the plans, but they are issued by private insurance companies.

D医保计划是涵盖处方药的私人计划的集合。联邦政府为这些计划制定了基本规则，但这些规则是由私人保险公司发布的。

Every prescription drug plan under Part D has different premiums, copayments and medications it covers. In choosing a plan, be sure not to focus solely on the lowest monthly premium and consider whether it covers the specific drugs needed and what type of copayments might apply. Different plans are offered in every state.

D 医保计划下的每个处方药计划都有不同的保费、共同支付和药物。在选择计划时，请务必不要只关注每月最低保费，并考虑是否涵盖所需的特定药物，以及可能适用哪种类型的共同支付。每个州都提供不同的计划。
