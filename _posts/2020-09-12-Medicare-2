### Medicare Part B  （B医保计划）

Part B is optional coverage that must be purchased. Every citizen and legal resident over 65 is eligible. 

B医保计划是必须购买的其他（余项）保险。每个65周岁的公民和合法居民都有资格。

Doctor bills are probably the biggest chunk of outpatient expenses that are covered. The category includes any service by a doctor wherever it’s provided — whether that’s a hospital, doctor’s office or clinic. It also covers any other work performed by the doctor’s staff, as well as any drugs administered in the office. 

医生账单可能是门诊费用中最大的一部分。该类别包括医生提供的任何服务，无论该服务在哪里提供，无论是医院、医生办公室还是诊所。它还包括医生的工作人员进行的任何其他工作，以及在办公室管理的任何药物。

For services to be covered, they must be ordered by a physician and be deemed medically necessary. They must also be provided by a doctor’s office or other provider that accepts Medicare and is approved by Medicare. 

若使用B医保服务，必须由医生订购，并被视为医疗上必要的服务。它们还必须由接受医疗保险并经医疗保险批准的医生办公室或其他提供商提供。

The monthly premium for Part B coverage is at least $144.60 (more for people with higher incomes) and is automatically deducted from Social Security checks. 

B医保计划每月保费至少为144.60美元（高收入者更多），自动从社会保障支票中扣除。

The program also has an annual deductible of $198. After the deductible, Medicare pays 80 percent of the approved amount for covered doctor services and 80 to 100 percent of the approved amount for outpatient services and medical equipment. 

该计划每年可扣除198美元。扣除额后，医疗保险支付80%的医生服务的核定医疗费，80%至100%的门诊服务和医疗设备的核定医疗费。

Timing is of the essence: If a potential enrollee waits until more than three months after their 65th birthday to enroll in Part B, they may not enroll until January 1 of the following year, and the coverage won’t start until July 1 of that year. 

时机至关重要：如果老人等到其65岁生日后3个月以上才去注册B医保计划，则他们可能要到次年1月1日才能注册上，保险时间要到同年7月1日才能开始。
