If you live in a sixth-story apartment, or your office is dozens of floors up in a high-rise, riding an elevator might be unavoidable.

如果你住在六层的步行公寓，或者你的办公室是几十层的高层（建筑），乘坐电梯可能是不可避免的。
 
But new research reveals that elevators can be coronavirus transmission hotspots, even if an infected person doesn't ride with anyone else. 

但新的研究表明，电梯可能是冠状病毒的传播热区，即使感染者不与其他人一起乘坐。
 
A woman traveled from the US back to her home in China's Heilongjiang province on March 19. Although she did not have any symptoms, she quarantined in her apartment following her arrival, avoiding any close contact with other residents. An antibody test would later reveal she was an asymptomatic coronavirus carrier.
 
3月19日，一名妇女从美国返回她在中国黑龙江省的家。虽然她没有任何症状，但她抵达后被隔离在她的公寓里，避免与其他居民有任何密切联系，抗体测试后来发现她是无症状冠状病毒携带者。

The two apartment-building neighbors had not crossed paths, but they had used the same elevator at different times, which explained the outburst of coronavirus in her neighborhood shortly after her arrival.

两个公寓楼的邻居没有交互通路。但他们在不同的时间都用过同样的电梯。这解释了为何在她抵达后不久疫情开始在居民区爆发。
 
According to a new CDC study, the downstairs neighbor "likely became infected by using the elevator in the building" after the asymptomatic carrier had ridden it, the study authors wrote. They think transmission likely occurred when the neighbor touched surfaces and buttons in the elevator.

根据疾病预防控制中心的一项新研究，在无症状的携带者乘坐电梯后，楼下的邻居"很可能被使用过的电梯感染了"。他们认为传染可能发生在邻居触摸电梯的表面和按钮时。
 
The main problem when it comes to coronavirus and elevators is that elevators are small, enclosed indoor spaces. These are the ideal conditions for the coronavirus' spread, since it's expelled in droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.

当涉及到冠状病毒和电梯时，主要问题是电梯都是小型的封闭式室内空间。这些都是冠状病毒传播的理想条件，因为当感染者咳嗽、打喷嚏或说话时，这种病毒会以液滴喷出。
 
Elevators also tend to lack strong airflow, which means that people who have coronavirus (no matter whether they're asymptomatic or feeling ill only) could leave some virus behind.

电梯也往往缺乏强大的空气对流，这意味着患有疫情（无论他们是无症状的携带者或仅仅感觉不适）的人可能会留下一些病毒。
 
Although it's not common, a person can get the coronavirus if they touch a surface or object that has viral particles on it and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes.

虽然不常见，但一个人如果触摸表面或物体，而其表面上有活体病毒颗粒，然后触摸他们的嘴、鼻子或眼睛，他们就可以感染冠状病毒。
 
A study published last week found that talking loudly produces enough droplets to transmit the coronavirus to others, and that those droplets can linger in the air for at least eight minutes.

上周发表的一项研究发现，大声说话会产生足够的水滴将冠状病毒传给其他人，而且这些水滴在空气中至少会停留8分钟。
 
CDC guidelines stipulate that commonly touched surfaces, including those in public elevators, should be frequently cleaned and disinfected. Even so, it's important to "punch the buttons with something other than your fingers, such as gloves".

CDC 防疫中心指南规定，通常接触的表面（包括公共电梯中的接触表面）应经常进行清洁和消毒。即便如此，重要的是"用手指以外的东西敲打按钮， 比如使用手套"。
