Doctors have strongly warned against using disinfectant to treat coronavirus. Their plea
follows suggestions by US President Donald Trump that disinfectant could be used to
treat COVID-19. President Trump said: "I see the disinfectant, where it knocks [the
virus] out in one minute....Is there a way we can do something like that by injection?...It
gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs." Mr Trump said his
comments had been made "sarcastically". The White House said the media took the
comments out of context and wrote "negative headlines".

医生强烈警告不要使用消毒剂来治疗冠状病毒。此前，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普建议使用消毒剂治疗COVID-19。特朗普总统说：
“我看到消毒剂，它一分钟内就将（病毒）消灭..是否有办法通过注射来做类似的事情?..它进入肺部，在肺部做大量的”。特朗普表示，
他的言论是“讽刺的”。白宫说，媒体断章取义地评论，并撰写了“负面的头条新闻”。

Disinfectants are toxic substances and can have fatal consequences if injected or
ingested. The maker of the best-selling disinfectant, Lysol, warned that its product
should &quot;under no circumstance&quot; be injected or ingested. The American Medical
Association also joined in the chorus of concern. It said: &quot;It is unfortunate that I have to
comment on this, but people should under no circumstances ingest or inject bleach or
disinfectant.&quot; It added: &quot;Rest assured, when we eventually find a treatment for or
vaccine against COVID-19, it will not be in the cleaning supplies aisle”.

消毒剂是有毒物质，如果注射或摄入，可能会产生致命的后果。最畅销的消毒剂制造商
Lysol警告说，其产品"在任何情况下都不应"被注射或摄入。美国医学协会也加入了关注
的行列。说："很不幸，我不得不对此发表评论，但人们在任何情况下都不应该摄入或注射漂白剂或消毒剂。它补充说：&quot;请放心，当我们最终找到针对COVID-19的治疗或疫苗时
，它将不会在清洁用品通道中“。
